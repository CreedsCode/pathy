# pathy - Azure Static webapp - find a route to walk
I just made it because I had fun to test the preview with the free demo, can't host it on my own because I am not able to set azure up.

So feel free to do it on your own!
just set the env var secret to the  https://openrouteservice.org/ api key!

btw, I spend way to much time in this project! I appreciate it, with at least giving it the chance to sit here.

# next goal:
write the backend in ts express.
